# DiscordBotChat

This Discord ChatBot uses an LLM, via OpenRouter, to communicate with Discord users when mentioned.

The model used is llama-3.3-70b-instruct by Meta. It has a large number of parameters and is fine-tuned for instructions, making it decent for this chatbot purpose. Plus its 'flexibility' on wording makes it great to have in a server with friends, due to some interesting answers it may provide. It also supports many languages.

To update the instructions, change the instructions.txt file.
